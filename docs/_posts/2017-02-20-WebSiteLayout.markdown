# Website Layout 

## What Do I want to show?

### Graphs
* A graph area consisting of
    * The main graph
    * A time liner (above the main graph)
    * A range slider to clamp the main graph by date
    * A way to filter events by people involved
* A choice to resize the graph either by number of events or size (time / cost) of events
* A way to find a particular element via text input (hopefully smarter then by exact match...)
* Maybe I want to be able to change type of graphs or display more than one graph

### Data Trail
* A secondary area listing all events, in summary form, leading to the currently selected event
    * Ideally there is a way of searching / filtering this trail 

### Detailed Data
* A tertiary area where further items relating to the current event are listed.
* Items can be
    * Email
    * Pdf's (meeting minutes, drawings, specifications)
    * Images, maybe screen shots of a particular location in the model(?)
