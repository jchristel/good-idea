# A Blog 

I've been toying with the idea of writing a blog for some time now but haven't had the right motivation or means to get started.

[This]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-01-welcome %}) project offers me the right motivation because I do want to keep a log of my progress. 
In addition the other day GitHub pages, a free service, was pointed out to me, which sorts out the means bit.

## Set up

I created two repositories on GitHub. First one will host live pages showcasing the progress I've made so far. This is quite important to me since I realized that static images do not convey well the workings of a web site. Especially if that involves animated data driven by D3.

The second repository will host this blog. There is a great tutorial here on how to set this up next to the samples web site.

## Improvements

* Show reel site
    * Create a landing page with links to the varies sample pages and this blog.


* Blog
    * Download and install a jekyll theme to offer up some basic navigation
