# Tutorials

I'm just amazed how many tutorials are on the internet pretty much covering everything. Which is invaluable to me since I am new to javascript and D3.

## D3 tutorials
* [nice start](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/) 
* loads of youtube tuts out there too

## help!
* Stack overflow: [SO](http://stackoverflow.com) Couldnt live without it!

## Old vs New

The first problem I came across when re-using samples is D3 versioning. Some samples I planned to borrow from used version 4 meanwhile, the majority of samples, used the older version 3. 

To find out which version of D3 is being used check the header of the .html file:
* version 3
```html
<script src="//d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
```

* version 4
```html
<script src="//d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

The `.min` stand for a compacted version which is faster to load.

Unfortunately for somebody who is new to javascript (me) this is a bit of a problem. Some of the issues I could solve by looking [here](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md). 

At the end I decided to stick to the newer version 4.
