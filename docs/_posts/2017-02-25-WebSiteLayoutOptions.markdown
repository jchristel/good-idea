# Website Layout 

## Easy stuff

In my previous [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-20-WebSiteLayout %}) I listed what I would like to show on the web site.

I can implement that fairly easily through a 3 column layout. This [one](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-3-column.htm) looks promising. I will just need to work out how to change the width of the columns to suit my needs.

Column one would be the graph area. Meanwhile column two and three are data areas. 

This is ok for now but is not very flexible in terms of being able to re-arrange item to suit a particular users preferences.  

## The hard (unknown) stuff

Widgets I think might be a much more flexible approach then a fixed layout altogether.

## For now

I will stick to a fixed three column layout for the moment simply because it is fairly easy to implement and will suffice to convey the intent. If things go really, really well then I can revisit this item.
