# Working on the back end 

## More Data

I am now at a stage where I want to gather data from other projects in the studio. Whilst Excel is still an option its not great for varies reasons:

* Clunky and boring
* It does not support multiple users simultaneously adding data


## MySQL

To keep things simple I will start with the least amount of tables for now.

![mySql]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/201703MySQL_BW.svg){:class="img-responsive"}{: height="400px" width="600px"}

* Projects
    * required to assign design events to a particular project

* User
    * required to assign a log entry to a user to allow for filtering of the main graph

* DesignEvents
    * this is basically the main table for now collecting all the data 
    * ProjectID is a 'Foreign Key' in this table allowing to filter design events by project:

    ```sql
    SELECT  EventID, EventName, ... FROM  designevents 
    WHERE Project ID = x;
    ```

* DesignLogs
   * this will record user and time spent against a particular design event once I have some front end ready...

## MySQL Environment

To get the tables setup and initial data pushed into them I use MySQL [workbench]{{ site.baseurl }} (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). This is an easy to use Graphical User Interface with a scripting shell build in.

Using a script to set up the tables and user and to populate the database with data allows me to reinstate everything from scratch in a matter of seconds when working with MAMP. Might need to look into a dedicated [LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0078UIFF2) server down the track.
