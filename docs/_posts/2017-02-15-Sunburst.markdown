# Sunburst

## Starting point

I started of with a combination of two samples: 
* [First](http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/) because I liked the option to drill down into the data by 'zooming' into the graph. In addition it has a legend which shows the entire path from the start to the element one hovers over.
* [Second](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063423) because it provided an option to resize the diagram depending on size of entry. (Think of size as time or cost value.)

## Where from here?
* The one drawback of the sunburst diagram is that it does not (at least in the moment) reflect a timeline. Events are just stacked hierarchical. Unfortunately that means that events on the same ring do not necessarily ocurred at the same time. One way to show a time line is by amending the bread crumb trail to reflect the date along the X-Axis.

* Another feature, which would be handy, is to clamp the events displayed by a date range or in other words just show me what happened in between two dates. I could do that via some date picker boxes or, better even, with a range slider.

* Last but not least I want to display more information on an event once the user selects it.
